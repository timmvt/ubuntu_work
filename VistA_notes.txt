To install on Ubuntu, follow the steps given in the installation guide. For convenience sake I have put them below.

(1) Install Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
    (a) ...]# vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
(2) Install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
(3) Install Git (http://www.git-scm.com/)
(4) Clone the VistA repository
    (a) ...]# cd ~
    (b) ...]# mkdir Development
    (c) ...]# cd Development
    (d) ...]# git clone https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA.git
(5) Provision the vista development environment VM
    (a) ...]# cd Development/VistA/Scripts/Install/Ubuntu
    (b) ...]# vagrant up
        [NOTE: VistA will run through the process of setting up the box and might kick back with a shared folders error. See the error below.
		Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
		the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
		the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and can
	    	work properly. The command attempted was:

		mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` /vagrant /vagrant
		mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` /vagrant /vagrant

       SOLUTION:
	After this error occurs, the process exits and the command prompt is back on the screen. Type the following:
		...]# vagrant ssh
		[guest_box...]# sudo ln -s /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-4.3.10/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions /usr/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions
		[guest_box...]# exit
		...]# vagrant reload

(6) Done!
